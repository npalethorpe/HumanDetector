        <!--
            This is an important bit! You'll need to include either the minified version
            or the non-minified version in your code - grab a copy of the 'raw' file found
            in the 'lib' folder and include it local to your project - do not reference the
            raw file directly from my GitHub - that will not work as it doesn't supply the
            correct headers! (I know; I've been caught out before!)

            If you didn't know - the .min.js (minified) version is (or atleast should be)
            exactly the same as the non-minified version, its just been compressed down
            to make it lighter. You should use this version if you're not looking to alter
            the code.

            This is the important element!
            It can be called anything you like, you can even use classes if you'd like
            to handle multiple Human Detectors - You'll likely also have to give it a
            class name though to help differentiate between them!

            This div cannot have any inner elements - they'll just get wiped. It also
            doesn't require any styling being applied - styling will be applied in the
            JS.

            The following buttons are just here for show in the sample to illustrate
            how you can check whether the human detection has been successful or not
            or whether a computer has been identified. 
            Also it shows the reset functionality that allows you to manually clear
            the session down and restart from square 1.
